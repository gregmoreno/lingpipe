The induction of immediate-early (IE) response genes, such as egr-1,
c-fos, and c-jun, occurs rapidly after the activation of T
lymphocytes. The process of activation involves calcium mobilization,
activation of protein kinase C (PKC), and phosphorylation of tyrosine
kinases. p21(ras), a guanine nucleotide binding factor, mediates
T-cell signal transduction through PKC-dependent and PKC-independent
pathways. The involvement of p21(ras) in the regulation of
calcium-dependent signals has been suggested through analysis of its
role in the activation of NF-AT. We have investigated the inductions
of the IE genes in response to calcium signals in Jurkat cells (in the
presence of activated p21(ras)) and their correlated consequences.
