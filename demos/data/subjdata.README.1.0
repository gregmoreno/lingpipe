Data Format Summary 

- rotten_imdb.tar.gz: contains this readme and two data files that
  were used in the experiments described in Pang/Lee ACL 2004.

  Specifically: 

  * quote.tok.gt9.5000 contains 5000 subjective sentences (or snippets);

  * plot.tok.gt9.5000 contains 5000 objective sentences.  

  Each line in these two files corresponds to a single sentence or
  snippet; all sentences (or snippets) are down-cased.  Only sentences
  or snippets containing at least 10 tokens were included.  The
  sentences and snippets were labeled automatically, as described
  below (see section "Label Decision").
  	 
- subjectivity_html.tar.gz: The original source files from which the
  extracted, processed, labeled, length-filtered, and (randomly)
  selected data in rotten_imdb.tar.gz was derived.

  Specifically:

  The starting points for data acquisition were snippets of movie
  reviews from Rotten Tomatoes (http://www.rottentomatoes.com/) and
  plot summaries for movies from the Internet Movie Database
  (http://www.imdb.com).  The html files under the folder "subj" are
  webpages containing Rotten Tomatoes snippets; the html files under
  the folder "obj" are pages containing IMDb plot summaries. The
  sentences/snippets in rotten_imdb.tar.gz represent a processed
  subset of these files.
   
=======

Label Decision 

We assumed that all snippets from the Rotten Tomatoes pages are
subjective, and all sentences from IMDb plot summaries are objective.
This is mostly true; but plot summaries can occasionally contain
subjective sentences that are mis-labeled as objective.
