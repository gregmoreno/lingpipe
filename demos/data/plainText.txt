If the Yankees lose a playoff spot by a game or two, these are the
nights that will sting all winter. On Tuesday, they lost on a blown
save and a bases-loaded walk. On Wednesday, somehow, it got much
worse.

An error by Robinson Cano set up the tying run. A wild pitch by Tanyon
Sturtze, who got his signals crossed with catcher Jorge Posada, scored
the go-ahead run. The result was a 7-6 victory for the last-place
Tampa Bay Devil Rays, who have beaten the Yankees 9 of 13 times this
season.
